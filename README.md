# Troy Cleans · Pool Site


Demo marketing site for Troy Burdett's creator-driven pool cleaning business (**Burdett Blue Pool Co.**). Built with Next.js 15, Tailwind v4, and Motion. All content is mock data — designed to feel real, easy to swap for production content.

## One-tap deploy

## Where to swap in real content

Everything lives in **`src/lib/data/`**. See `CONTENT.md` for a field-by-field guide.

| Data file | What's in it |
|---|---|
| `brand.ts` | Name, tagline, founder, contact, socials, service area |
| `stats.ts` | Hero counter values + marquee ticker |
| `videos.ts` | Video gallery items (platform, thumbnail, URL, views) |
| `gallery.ts` | Before/after pairs with locations + stories |
| `services.ts` | Pricing tiers |
| `products.ts` | Affiliate shop items |
| `testimonials.ts` | Reviews + aggregate rating |
| `faqs.ts` | FAQ entries (drive FAQPage schema) |
| `posts.ts` | Blog posts (structured content blocks) |
| `cities.ts` | Geo landing pages |
| `sponsors.ts` | Supporter wall + funding progress |
| `press.ts` | "As seen on" logos |

## Forms

All forms are client-side with `react-hook-form` + `zod` validation. They currently log to console and redirect to `/success`. To wire up real submissions:

- **Booking / Nominate / Contact**: integrate Resend or Formspree — see comments in each form component.
- **Sponsor**: integrate Stripe Checkout — see `SponsorForm`.

Env var placeholders are in `.env.example`.

## Deployment

**Vercel (recommended):**
1. Import this repo in Vercel.
2. Set the **Root Directory** to `pool-site`.
3. Add any env vars from `.env.example` you want enabled.
4. Deploy.

**Other hosts:** any platform that supports Next.js 15 App Router will work.

## Browser support

Modern evergreen browsers. Uses `backdrop-filter`, `color-mix()`, and `clamp()` — all supported in Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge.

## Accessibility

- Skip-to-content link
- Visible focus rings
- Reduced-motion respected
- All form fields labelled
- AAA contrast on primary text
- Semantic HTML, proper heading hierarchy
